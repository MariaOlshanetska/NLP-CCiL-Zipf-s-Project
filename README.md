# Zipf's Law of Abbreviation in Twitch Chats

This project analyzes the adherence to Zipf's Law of Abbreviation in Twitch chat messages from Hearthstone Battlegrounds streams in both English and Spanish. Zipf's Law of Abbreviation suggests that more frequently used words tend to be shorter. Here, we compare the relationship between token frequency and token length across these two languages and statistically evaluate any differences.

## Overview

- **Objective:**  
  To test whether Zipf's Law of Abbreviation holds in Twitch chat data (a non-traditional text genre) for English and Spanish, and to compare the strength of this relationship across the two languages.

- **Method:**  
  The analysis involves reading CSV files containing Twitch chat logs, filtering out bot messages (lines where the second column equals "streamelements"), tokenizing the chat messages while removing punctuation, calculating token frequencies and lengths, and performing Pearson correlation analysis. Finally, the correlations are compared using Fisherâ€™s r-to-z transformation.

## Data

The project requires two CSV files placed in the project root:
- `english.csv`: Twitch chat logs from English Hearthstone Battlegrounds streams.
- `spanish.csv`: Twitch chat logs from Spanish Hearthstone Battlegrounds streams.

**Note:**  
- The first three columns are ignored.
- The fourth column (or a column named `message`) contains the chat messages.
- The second column is used to filter out bot messages (where the value is "streamelements").
